= TLS Library

This library provides an API for creating basic SSL/TLS connections with standard {jsse}.
The Library is implemented in {kotlin} and is also supposed to be used with Java in feature versions.
The Kotlin API is implemented with a _"type-safe builder"_ approach, which is quite popular in the Groovy community.

*Disclaimer*: _The current Version is not optimized for Java yet_

== Motivation

If you also find it hard to use the complex JSSE structure to create your SSL sockets, which also generates lots of boilerplate when used directly, this tool is what you've been looking for.

The library provides means for creating `SSLSocketFactories` that can be used for most use cases where TLS/SSL connections are required. It's also supposed to provide usage examples and even sample implementations like SSL enabled servers, Apache Http Clients, etc. you can use directly in your application.

== Demo of Kotlin DSL

In the following you can see some basic examples of using the Kotlin DSL for setting up ssl-(server)-socket-factories.

=== Creating a client socket for mutual authentication (client keystore must be provided):

[source, kotlin]
----
   val fac = socketFactory {
        keyManager {
            storeFile = Paths.get("certsandstores/clientkeystore")
            password = "123456"
            fileType = "jks"
        }
        trustManager {
            storeFile = Paths.get("certsandstores/myTruststore")
            password = "123456"
            fileType = "jks"
        }
        sockets {
            cipherSuites = listOf("TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256", "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
                    "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA")
            timeout = 10_000
        }
    }

    val socket = fac.createSocket("192.168.3.10", 443)

----

=== Creating a server socket with simple keystore (no client auth required)

[source, kotlin]
----
  val fac = serverSocketFactory {
            keyManager {
                storeFile = Paths.get("certsandstores/clientkeystore")
                password = "123456"
                fileType = "jks"
            }
        }

        val accept = fac.createServerSocket(443).accept()
    }
----

== Basics

TLS/SSL are cryptographic protocols used to encrypt computer network communication.

=== TLS Scenarios

a) Server is authenticated by the client only +
b) Client is authenticated by server additionally to a) (*Mutual Authentication*)

=== Terms

.Keystore (JKS, PKCS12)

Contains private key(s) and certificate(s) used by TLS/SSL servers/clients to authenticate themselves to the other party.

.Truststore (JKS)

Contains certificates of trusted servers/clients or trusted CAs, no key(s) contained.

=== Appendix A: Using keytool for creating your own stores

See this tutorial for more details: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/

==== Create your own KeyStore in JKS format

1. CA Create: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21297139/how-do-you-sign-certificate-signing-request-with-your-certification-authority

2. *Create PrivateKey:* keytool -keystore clientkeystore -genkey -alias client
*Create Certificate signing request:* keytool -keystore clientkeystore -certreq -alias client -keyalg rsa -file client.csr
3. *Sign the CSR*: openssl  x509  -req  -CA ca-certificate.pem.txt -CAkey ca-key.pem.txt -in client.csr -out client.cer  -days 365  -CAcreateserial

4. keytool -import -keystore clientkeystore -file ca-certificate.pem.txt
5. keytool –import –keystore clientkeystore –file client.cer –alias client -alias theCARoot


====  Creating a TrustStore

Simply add your CAs to a keystore...

1. keytool -import -file ca.cert -alias firstCA -keystore myTrustStore
